Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

The app was desgined to allow users to track items in an inventory.  It needed to allow them to log in using a user name and password, add items to the inventory, edit existing items in the inventory, and remove items from the inventory.  If the user granted SMS permissions, it also needed to send an SMS notification when the stock level of an item reached zero.

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

The app needed a log in screen, and inventory screen, an add new item screen, a edit existing item screen, and a settings screen.  My UI designs kept users in mind by relying on common iconography to reduce the learning curve new users experienced with the app.  They were successful because the created an intuitive workflow between screens.

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?

Usually when I develop a program I create functionality first and then design a frontend to support it.  Because of the project structure in this course, however, that process was reversed for this app.  For the most part, I found this to be a successful approach.  Additionally, breaking the project up into screens naturally created manageable sub tasks to work on.

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?

I launched it and pressed all the buttons.  Initially, many of them worked, but some did not and required refactoring.  This process is important because if it is skipped, the nonfunctional items would not have been identified and corrected.

Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

UI/UX desgin is not a skill I have strongly developed, so I found myself iterating on the design for the front end repeatedly.

In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

I felt my implementation of the SQLite database, and specifically security concious practices like storing password hashes instead of plaintext passwords, was a successful demonstration of my awareness of security concerns.
